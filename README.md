# Interactive Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Project Overview
This project employs logistic regression to predict heart disease using a dataset of various medical attributes. The goal is to leverage data science for meaningful predictions that can aid in early detection and inform healthcare strategies.

## Dataset
The heart.csv dataset consists of 303 entries and 14 attributes related to heart disease. Attributes include age, sex, types of chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and others. There are no missing values in the dataset, ensuring a robust basis for analysis.

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed with Python 3. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:
```pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn```

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and launch the Jupyter Notebook:


```git clone https://github.com/Drew-Hobbs/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git```
```cd Heart-Disease-Prediction```
```jupyter notebook```
Open the Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis and view the predictions.

## Methodology
The project follows a comprehensive approach, starting with data loading, followed by exploration and visualization, preprocessing, model training and evaluation, and concluding with further visualizations and interactive prediction capabilities.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides insights into the significance of various features for heart disease prediction, such as chest pain type, resting EKG results, exercise-induced angina, and more. Detailed observations are included within the notebook.
