# Interactive Heart Disease Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Project Overview
This project employs logistic regression to predict heart disease using a dataset of various medical attributes. The goal is to leverage data science for meaningful predictions that can aid in early detection and inform healthcare strategies.

## Documentation
### Heart Disease Prediction Capstone Project.docx
This document forms part of the capstone project for the Bachelor's of Computer Science program at Western Governors University. It proposes a machine learning solution, specifically logistic regression, to predict heart disease. This hypothetical detailed write-up includes the project's objectives, methodology, expected benefits for HealthCare Services Inc., and a comprehensive evaluation plan. It highlights the project's aim to enhance diagnostic accuracy, optimize resource allocation, and personalize patient care, with an anticipated accuracy rate above 75%.

## Dataset
Our heart.csv dataset is a robust collection of 303 records across 14 heart-related attributes. Attributes include age, sex, types of chest pain, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting ECG results, maximum heart rate, exercise-induced angina, and others. 

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed with Python 3. Additionally, the following libraries are required:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To use this project, clone the repository and launch the Jupyter Notebook:


```
git clone https://github.com/AHDataWorks/Heart-Disease-Prediction.git
cd Heart-Disease-Prediction
jupyter notebook
```

Open the Heart Disease Prediction.ipynb notebook and run the cells to perform the analysis. The last cell allows the user to input their own values for the parameters the model uses, and will be provided a prediction 

## Methodology
The project encompasses data loading, exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interactive prediction, offering a holistic view of data science application.

## Conclusions
The analysis provides insights into the significance of various features for heart disease prediction, such as chest pain type, resting EKG results, exercise-induced angina, and more. Detailed observations are included within the notebook.
